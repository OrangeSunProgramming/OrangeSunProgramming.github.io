    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Marcos Masip, a passionate and driven data scientist, mathematician, and machine learning enthusiast. I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, earning a 4.0 GPA, and I’m currently pursuing a master’s degree in Mathematics at Florida International University, where I continue to hone my analytical and research skills.

I specialize in applying mathematics, coding, and deep learning to solve complex problems. My portfolio includes projects such as:

* Developing a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) from scratch to compare against CNNs for brain tumor classification.
      
* Classifying heart beat sounds using spectrogram-based multi-label deep learning models.
      
* Implementing reinforcement learning algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to optimize strategies in simulated environments.

* Implementing an inception like model build using TensorFlow for pneumonia classification tasks.
      
With certifications in Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning from Stanford Online and DeepLearning.AI, I am deeply invested in creating innovative solutions at the intersection of technology and mathematics. I also bring experience as an AI trainer, having contributed to improving AI models for mathematical reasoning.

Beyond coding, I am passionate about education and have a proven track record of teaching high school students math, chemistry, and space engineering, inspiring them to pursue STEM careers.

When I’m not immersed in machine learning projects, I enjoy exploring cutting-edge technologies, gaming, and creating tools that simplify complex concepts for learners worldwide. I’m seeking opportunities to contribute to impactful projects, work with innovative teams, and continue to grow as a data scientist and machine learning expert.</p>
